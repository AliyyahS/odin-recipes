        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a shallow dish or a wide bowl, whisk together the eggs, whole milk, granulated sugar, vanilla extract, 
            ground cinnamon, and a pinch of salt until well combined.</li>
            <li>Preheat a griddle or large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add a bit of butter or cooking oil to prevent 
            sticking.</li>
            <li>Take a slice of bread and dip it into the egg mixture, ensuring both sides are well-coated. Allow any excess liquid 
            to drip off.</li>
            <li>Place the dipped bread slice onto the preheated griddle or skillet. Cook for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or 
            until they are golden brown and slightly crispy. Adjust the heat as needed to avoid burning.</li>
            <li>Serve your perfect French toast with your favorite toppings, such as maple syrup, a dusting of powdered sugar, 
            fresh berries, or sliced bananas.</li>
